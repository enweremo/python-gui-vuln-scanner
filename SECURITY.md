No production support or security patches are guaranteed. Users are responsible for maintaining their own secure environments when running this project.

## 2) Responsible Use
- Use this tool **only on systems you own or are explicitly authorized to test**.  
- Running scans against external systems without permission may be illegal and unethical.  
- Ensure all tests comply with local laws, institutional guidelines, and acceptable use policies.  

## 3) Ethical Use
The project emphasizes ethical use and includes explicit reminders within the interface and documentation.  
Testing was strictly limited to lab environments. Users are cautioned that unauthorized scanning of external systems is illegal and may violate cybersecurity laws.  
The tool is provided strictly for educational, research, and demonstration purposes.

## 4) Reporting a Vulnerability
If you identify a bug or security issue in the source code:
1. Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability before reporting.  
2. Open a private issue in the repository or contact the maintainer directly.  
3. Provide detailed steps to reproduce the problem.  

Reports will be reviewed, but fixes and timelines are not guaranteed, as this project is intended for academic demonstration.

## 5) Data Handling and Privacy
- Scan results may contain sensitive information about the systems under test.  
- Treat exported reports as confidential data.  
- Do not upload results to public repositories or share them without sanitization.  

## 6) External Dependencies
This project relies on third-party tools such as:
- **Nmap**
